I am currently a PhD candidate in the Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University. I spent two years for my master's degree and four years for my PhD under the supervision of Dr. Vianney Denis.

My research focuses on community ecology, benthic ecology, coral reef ecology, conservation, and the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems. My PhD project is (1) to identify different marine coastal benthic communities, including those found in marginal areas of tropical reefs such as high-latitude and mesophotic areas. For these identified communities, I (2) further examine their relationship with environmental drivers, and (3) the roles they can play for reef fish species under global warming. In this context, the waters around Taiwan constitute an excellent natural laboratory to study those topics because the environment around Taiwan is very contrasted. Furthermore, I am also interested in marine biodiversity, and I would love to develop some side projects about it.
